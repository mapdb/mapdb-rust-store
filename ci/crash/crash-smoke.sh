# process-crash-smoke (the mapdb5 port of the io_uring engine's crash harness): the
# UNPRIVILEGED tier — SIGKILL at a random point after readiness, on the host
# filesystem, no device fault. This proves process-crash consistency and wires
# the harness binaries against the real StoreWAL open/log-replay/recovery path;
# it is NOT a power-cut test (the OS page cache survives SIGKILL) and a green run
# here is no ext4/XFS durability evidence — that is ci/crash/crash-tier.sh's job.
# Any failure is a real bug by definition: an acked-then-lost write, a corrupt
# reopen, or a format v3 segment namespace the recovery left in a state no
# sequence of create/unlink/residue-delete could have produced.
#
# WAL only: mapdb5's StoreDirect is non-transactional (an uncommitted in-place
# mutation makes a reopen fail the header checksum by design), so only the WAL
# backend is crash-recoverable and only WAL is exercised here.
